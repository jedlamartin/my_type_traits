# my_type_traits
This project is an educational exploration of C++ Template Metaprogramming (TMP). It implements a collection of compile-time type traits and detection idioms from scratch, mimicking functionality found in the standard `<type_traits>` header.

The implementation relies heavily on **C++11** features, specifically **SFINAE** (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error), template specialization, and `constexpr` functions to perform type introspection without using compiler intrinsics.
